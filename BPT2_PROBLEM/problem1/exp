Let's break down the given command step by step. It consists of two `grep` commands, where the output of the first is passed as input to the second using a pipe (`|`).

### Full Command:
```bash
grep -o '>[A-Z][a-z]\+<' demo | grep -o '[^<>]\+'
```

### Step 1: First `grep`
```bash
grep -o '>[A-Z][a-z]\+<' demo
```

#### Explanation:
- **`grep`**: Searches for patterns in a file or input.
- **`-o`**: Only prints the part of the line that matches the pattern, not the entire line.
- **`'>[A-Z][a-z]\+<'`**:
  - **`>`**: Matches the literal `>` character.
  - **`[A-Z]`**: Matches a single uppercase letter (A to Z).
  - **`[a-z]\+`**: Matches one or more (`\+`) lowercase letters (a to z).
  - **`<`**: Matches the literal `<` character.

This pattern matches strings like `>Hello<`, `>World<`, or `>Example<` in the file `demo`.

**Output example**:
If the file `demo` contains:
```
<html><body>Welcome to <b>Example</b>!</body></html>
```
The output would be:
```
>Example<
```

### Step 2: Second `grep`
```bash
grep -o '[^<>]\+'
```

#### Explanation:
- **`grep`**: Searches for patterns in input (in this case, the output of the first `grep`).
- **`-o`**: Prints only the matching part of the input.
- **`'[^<>]\+'`**:
  - **`[^<>]`**: Matches any character *except* `<` or `>` (the `^` inside `[]` negates the match).
  - **`\+`**: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern.

This step extracts the part of the string between the `>` and `<` characters.

**Input example**:
From the previous step, the input is:
```
>Example<
```

**Output**:
```
Example
```

### Combined Command:
When these two commands are combined:
1. The first `grep` extracts all strings that look like `>Text<` from the file `demo`.
2. The second `grep` removes the `>` and `<`, leaving only the text inside.

---

### Final Output Example:
If `demo` contains:
```
<html><body>Welcome to <b>Example</b>!</body></html>
```
The command:
```bash
grep -o '>[A-Z][a-z]\+<' demo | grep -o '[^<>]\+'
```
Outputs:
```
Example
```
